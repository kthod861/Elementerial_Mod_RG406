# Elementerial_Classic_RG406
A personnal modification of [RobZombie elementarial theme](https://github.com/RobZombie9043/elementerial-es-de) for my Anbernic RG 406V .

Highly reduced the amount of options to just my needs.
A great way to learn how ED-DE themes works.

Almost all images have been tweaks
