# Elementerial_Classic_RG406
A personnal modification of [RobZombie elementarial theme](https://github.com/RobZombie9043/elementerial-es-de) for my Anbernic RG 406V .

Highly reduced the amount of options to just my needs ( grid only, one size ).

A great way to learn how ED-DE themes works.

Almost all systems images have been tweaked.

Should fit any 4:3 ratio with 960x720 resolution.
